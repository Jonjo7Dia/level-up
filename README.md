# Programmer Maturity Tests

This repository contains a set of problem solving issues for programmers.

Most issues can be resolved with basic understanding of TypeScript, but some of the
issues may require understanding of technologies such as React.

All issues can be found from `/issues` folder. Some related code also exists in `/src` folder,
but that code is not relevant for solving the issues.

The issues have been written for programmers from intermediate to advanced level.

## How to Solve the Issues

1. Make a private fork of this repository and checkout a new branch
2. Clone on your device and run `yarn` (make sure you have `yarn` installed)
3. Resolve [each issue in this repository](https://github.com/showell-labs/maturity-test/issues)

Finally, make a PR that points to your fork (not to original repo). Submit us a link to your PR.

## Good to Know

When there's a `jest` test written for the issue, that test should be also updated to
ensure that the issue has been properly solved.

There's usually no single truth for resolving the issue. Be creative if that's what is needed.

There may be issues that would require additional NPM modules to be installed in order
to fix the issues properly. It is OK to do so, but remember that there shouldn't be much
need for extra modules.

It is OK to use any sources to resolve the issues, but you'll be only fooling yourself
if you cannot resolve the issues with your current knowledge and some basic Googling.
