# Programmer maturity tests

This repository contains set of problem solving issues for programmers. The issues inculde
bug fixing, security issues and some tests that may require in-detail understanding of some
technology (like React).

All issues can be found from `/issues` folder. Some related code also exists in `/src` folder,
but that code is not relevant for solving the issues.

## How to solve the issues

1. Make a private fork of this repository and checkout a new branch
2. Go through each file in `/issues` folder
3. In the beginning of each file, there's a comment that describes the issue
4. Resolve the issue

Finally, make a PR that points to your private fork. Submit us a link to your PR.

When there's a `jest` test written for the issue, that test should be also updated to
ensure that the issue has been properly solved.

There may be issues that would require additional NPM modules to be installed in order
to fix the issues properly. It is OK to do so, but remember that there shouldn't be much
need for extra modules.

It is OK to use any sources to resolve the issues, but remember that you'll be
only fooling yourself if you cannot resolve the issues with your current knowledge and
some basic Googling.
